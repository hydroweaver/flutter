display unit8 list image
do ops on image



try getbytes implementation, lumiscence or new method on IMage lib images

I think this is what is used in multiple cases since there is no direct getbytes method


put MNIST code in new app, its copied so its not comng in device

put stuff in initstate

Reached here: let's try and display image later:

var x = await rootBundle.load(path);
    print(x.buffer);
