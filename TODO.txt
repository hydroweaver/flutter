display unit8 list image
do ops on image



try getbytes implementation, lumiscence or new method on IMage lib images

I think this is what is used in multiple cases since there is no direct getbytes method


put MNIST code in new app, its copied so its not comng in device

put stuff in initstate

Reached here: let's try and display image later:


I/flutter ( 3933): prediction: [4][{confidence: 0.2935374081134796, index: 5, label: 5}, {confidence: 0.14381198585033417, index: 7, label: 7}, {confidence: 0.11615131795406342, index: 4, label: 4}, {confidence: 0.1031794622540474, index: 1, label: 1}]

I know which format the image should be, so it can be this raw format which cant be seen on view but work.

I was able to retrieve the image from flttf project, save it disk and get it back again and predict on using image lib, which means....this is the format my image should be in, and its 1/4 of the jpg file...so the question is how to convert jpg to this fomrat
